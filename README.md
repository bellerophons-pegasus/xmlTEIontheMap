# xmlTEIontheMap
This is a hack created for the [ACDH virtual Open Data hackathon series 2019](https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/ACDHhackathonODD). It is a hacky, quick, and dirty proof of concept.
It was only executed on a part of [Das Mittelmeer. Handbuch f√ºr Reisende: Digitale Ausgabe](https://id.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/traveldigital/Corpus/Baedeker-Mittelmeer_1909.xml), due to time and performance constraints. Note that adding coordinates was limited to the mediterranean region only for this example.

You can view the result on: https://bellerophons-pegasus.github.io/xmlTEIontheMap/

## The idea
1. Take an annotated TEI encoded XML file where potential places are already marked as named entities in this way:
```xml
<w lemma="Athen" type="NE" xml:id="MM_d1e2915">Athen</w>
```

2. For each named entity try to determine if it is a place, then do some basic disambiguation and find coordinates for it.

3. Add the newly found coordinate information into the TEI encoded XML file according to [TEI specifications](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ND.html#NDGEOG); e.g.:
```xml
<place type="city">
  <w lemma="Athen" type="NE" xml:id="MM_d1e2915">Athen</w>
  <location>
  <geo>37.9838 23.7275</geo>
 </location>
</place>
```

4. Use the new file for display on a webpage. On left side: pretty formatted text (with [CETEIcean](https://github.com/TEIC/CETEIcean)). On right side: a leaflet map with markers of all places encoded in the currently visible snippet.

## Further work
* See initail comments in geocoding/geocode.py
* Clean up pagination display (not properly hidden elements)
* Add clustering of markers on map
* Link markers to their respective mention in the text and highlight it there
* Scale up to large documents

### Ideas for more
* Allow correction of coordinates in xml via map display
* Find an automated way to convert an XSLT to a css and behavior of CETEIcean

## Things used
* Python dependencies:
 * xml.etree
 * arcgis.gis
 * arcgis.geocoding
* [CETEIcean](https://github.com/TEIC/CETEIcean)
* [Pagination for CETEIcean](https://github.com/raffazizzi/ceteicean-pagination)

## Instructions for own use
* download repository
* install required libraries for Python mentioned above
* in geocoding/geocode.py in the section 'Parsing the xml-file' input your xml file
* execute geocoding/geocode.py
* copy the resulting file into source-web
* in index.html in the section 'CODE TO RUN CETEICEAN' change the source to your newly created source  
* open index.html in your browser and see the result
